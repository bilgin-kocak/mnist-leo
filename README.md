# MNIST Classifier in Leo using Neural Network
## Overview 

This repository contains a neural network classifier application, written in the Leo programming language. It's developed as part of the Aleo Hackathon and utilizes the MNIST dataset for training and testing purposes.  

## Installation 
### Prerequisites 
 - Docker: Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.  
 
### Running the Application 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 
2. Navigate to the cloned directory. 
3. Run the following command to start the application:

``` docker-compose up ```

## Usage  
-  **Training and Transpiling:** Use the `mnist_nn_leo_transpiler.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to train the neural network and transpile it to Leo language. 
-  **Data Set:** The application uses the MNIST dataset for training the neural network classifier.
